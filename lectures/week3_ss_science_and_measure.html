# Social Service Science

Applied science which addresses the use of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics to the delivery of social services. 

--

- Take existing scientific knowledge and apply this knowledge toward the development of practical applications such as **technology** or **interventions**.

--

- May also focus on describing or measuring **social problems**.

--

Most social service science focuses on the development of **interventions**.

--

### Our discussions over the next quarter will focus mostly on describing or measuring individual or social problems and using existing social service research to help solve these problems.

# Assigned Readings

From King, Keohane, &amp; Verba, (1994)

&gt; We assume that it is possible to have some knowledge of the external world but that such knowledge is always uncertain. 

--

This assumption exists independent of whether we are examining an issue *objectively* or *subjectively* (Searle, 1995). 

--

- Examining an issue *objectively* implies that we are examining an issue based on facts, etc. 

--

- *Subjectively* examining an issue can also be accomplished on the basis of facts.

# Assigned Readings

From King, Keohane, &amp; Verba, (1994)

*Characteristics of scientific research...*

--

&gt; The goal is inference

--

&gt; The procedures are public

--

&gt; The conclusions are uncertain 

--

&gt; The content is the method

--

These features apply equally to *analytical* case management decisions in direct service social work.

---

# Assigned Readings

From King, Keohane, &amp; Verba, (1994)

*Criteria for setting up a research project...*

--

&gt; A research project should pose a uestion that is "important" in the real world. 

--

&gt; A research project should make a specific contribution to ... [scholarship]

--

As direct service case managers, do these criteria apply to our work?

King is writing from the perspective of a political scientist. Do we have the same concerns as social welfare scholars and practitioners?

# From King's perspective, is there a difference between qualitative and quantitative science?

# Assigned Readings

NASW Code of Ethics

*1.03 Informed Consent*

&gt; Social workers should provide services to clients only in the context of a professional relationship based, when appropriate, on valid informed consent. Social workers should use clear and understandable language to inform clients of the purpose of the services, risks related to the services, limits to services because of the requirements of a third-party payer, relevant costs, reasonable alternatives, clients' right to refuse or withdraw consent, and the time frame covered by the consent. Social workers should provide clients with an opportunity to ask questions.

Do we routinely ask for informed consent in direct-service practice?

---

# Assigned Readings

NASW Code of Ethics

*1.04 Competence*

&gt; Social workers should provide services and represent themselves as competent only within the boundaries of their education, training, license, certification, consultation received, supervised experience, or other relevant professional experience.

Some of the measurement models we cover in this course require advanced training for administration and/or interpretation. What is our ethical obligation to clients in using and interpreting these models?

---

# Assigned Readings 

NASW Code of Ethics

*5.02 Evaluation and Research*

&gt; (d) Social workers engaged in evaluation or research should carefully consider possible consequences and should follow guidelines developed for the protection of evaluation and research participants. Appropriate institutional review boards should be consulted.

&gt; (e) Social workers engaged in evaluation or research should obtain voluntary and written informed consent from participants, when appropriate, without any implied or actual deprivation or penalty for refusal to participate; without undue inducement to participate; and with due regard for participants' well-being, privacy, and dignity. Informed consent should include information about the nature, extent, and duration of the participation requested and disclosure of the risks and benefits of participation in the research.

&gt; (o) Social workers should report evaluation and research findings accurately. They should not fabricate or falsify results and should take steps to correct any errors later found in published data using standard publication methods.

# Raw Data

What does the raw score of a particular test mean?

Most of the tests we will cover this quarter are "norm-referenced" tests. This means that the raw data from a test is compared to some larger distribution. 

![](week3_ss_science_and_measure_files/figure-html/std_normal-1.svg)&lt;!-- --&gt;

---

# Raw Data

What does the raw score of a particular test mean?

Some tests use a particular criterion - "criterion-referenced tests"

Do you have to take this class?

---

# Raw Data

## Important thing to note about raw scores...

- They need to be put in context (either via a norm or some criteria)

- This is especially important in psychometric tests (e.g. intelligence, personality)

---

# Individuals and Populations

## Focusing (for now) on norm-referenced tests...

- Our goal is to take an individual test score, and understand how that person sits relative to a larger population. 

- We *cannot* usually have data on all members of a population. 

- We *can* compare our individual to a "standardization sample".

- This information should sit within the test documentation. 

---

# Individuals and Populations

## Sample variation...

- The sample from which a given test was derived, has variation within a given sample. 

- The sample from which a given test was derived, will probably have been different given a different population - this is *sampling variation*. 

---

# Individuals and Populations

## Sample variation...

- Does the variation matter?

- It depends on whether or not the variation is systematic or unsystematic. 

- Systematic variation *may* indicate bias (i.e. a *misprepresenation* of a given construct).

- Systematic variation *may also* indicate relevant variation in a particular population (e.g. age in the case of personality tests).

# Conspiracies Against the Laity

## Mean

`$${\displaystyle {\bar {x}}={\frac {1}{n}}\left(\sum _{i=1}^{n}{x_{i}}\right)={\frac {x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots +x_{n}}{n}}}$$`

## Standard Deviation

`$$s_{n}={\sqrt {{\frac {1}{(n-1)}}\sum _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\overline {x}})^{2}}}$$`

## The relevance of mean and standard deviation

# Conspiracies Against the Laity

Underlying assumption of almost all psychological measurement - asymptotic normality. 

The mathematical definition of the "normal distribution" is as follows: 

`$${\displaystyle \Pr(x\;|\;\mu ,\sigma ^{2})={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi \sigma ^{2}}}}\;e^{-{\frac {(x-\mu )^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}}}$$`
Using the notation from above, `\(\overline {x} \approx \mu\)` and `\(s \approx \sigma\)`.

If we believe the assumption of normality, we can calculate "z-scores" for a given test to contextualize a score against a larger population. 

`$$z={x-\mu  \over \sigma }.$$`
---

# Conspiracies Against the Laity

From here, many psychological measures convert to a different scale for the sake of interpretation. For example, in the case of IQ, we convert the z-score to a scale in which the standard deviation is 15 and the mean is 100. In other words, we perform the following arithmetic to our z-score: 

`$$SS={z\cdot15+100},$$`
where `\(SS\)` is a generic symbol for "standard score".

---

# Letting the laity move up!

Let's collect some data and look at it in R

- Is it symmetrical? *skewness*

- What is the shape? *kurtosis*

- What is the middle value? *median*

- What value happens the most? *mode*

- What is the average value? *mean*

- What is the average variance of the data? *standard deviation*

- Are there any outliers?

- What is our z-score?

- Can we standardize the z-score to a "birth-weight" IQ?
